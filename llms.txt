- Rust (Tokio) - Computational intensity and performance-critical code paths
- TypeScript/JavaScript - Full stack web development

**Core Competencies:**
- Hybrid Rust/Python system architectures leveraging each language's strengths
- Real-time data processing and event stream monitoring
- Pattern detection algorithms for high-volume data streams
- Low-latency execution (sub-100ms response times)
- Async/await patterns and concurrent programming
- FFI integration between Rust and Python
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

**Distributed Systems:**
- Automated transaction execution systems
- Real-time event monitoring and pattern detection
- API integration for distributed platforms
- Resilient error handling and automatic reconnection logic
- Persistent WebSocket connections

## Featured Projects

### RAGnificent
[GitHub](https://github.com/krljakob/RAGnificent): Hybrid Rust/Python documentation scraper achieving 10x faster processing than pure Python implementations. Rust handles computationally intensive HTML parsing while Python provides developer-friendly integration. Converts web content to LLM-optimized markdown, JSON, and XML with real-time animated architecture visualization.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Rust core for high-performance HTML parsing
- Python wrapper for developer experience
- Async/Tokio for concurrent operations
- Multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, XML)

### CCPrompts
[GitHub](https://github.com/ursisterbtw/ccprompts): Community-driven collection of AI prompts and workflows for development automation. Built infrastructure for collaborative prompt engineering with 54 GitHub stars and 7 forks. Designed patterns for code generation, refactoring automation, and developer productivity tooling.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Prompt engineering patterns
- AI-driven development workflows
- Code generation automation
- Open source community building
